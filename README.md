# mladv-project
Project in Machine Learning, Advanced Course. 

To compile ssk_c.pyx (cython version of ssk), in Kernel_implementation/ run:
'python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace'

- Decrease dataset
- Only account for one category
- Try to vary the parameters to get the general behavior
- If no chunking, save each kernel K_i for each i <= n.



Goals in report and presentation

- Discuss chunking performance?
- Show behavior when varying parameters
